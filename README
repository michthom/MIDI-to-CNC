Utility to process a Standard MIDI File (*.SMF/*.mid) to "play" it on up to 3
axes of a CNC machine.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Input settings:
  -infile [INFILE], --infile [INFILE]
                        the input MIDI filename (default: ./input.mid)
  -channels N [N ...], --channels N [N ...]
                        list of MIDI channels you want to scan for event data
                        (default: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
                        13, 14, 15])
  -outfile [OUTFILE], --outfile [OUTFILE]
                        the output Gcode filename (default: ./output.gcode)

Machine settings:
  -machine {cupcake,custom,shapercube,thingomatic,ultimaker}, --machine {cupcake,custom,shapercube,thingomatic,ultimaker}
                        sets everything up appropriately for predefined
                        machines, or flags use of custom settings. (default:
                        cupcake)

Customised settings:
  -units {imperial,metric}, --units {imperial,metric}
                        set the measurement and feed rate units to your
                        preferred scheme. (default: metric)
  -ppu XXX.XX YYY.YY ZZZ.ZZ, --ppu XXX.XX YYY.YY ZZZ.ZZ
                        set arbitrary pulses-per-unit (ppu) for each of the X,
                        Y and Z axes (default: None)
  -safemin XXX.XX YYY.YY ZZZ.ZZ, --safemin XXX.XX YYY.YY ZZZ.ZZ
                        set minimum edge of the safe envelope for each of the
                        X, Y and Z axes (default: None)
  -safemax XXX.XX YYY.YY ZZZ.ZZ, --safemax XXX.XX YYY.YY ZZZ.ZZ
                        set maximum edge of the safe envelope for each of the
                        X, Y and Z axes (default: None)
  -prefix [PRE_FILE], --prefix [PRE_FILE]
                        A file containing Gcode to set your machine to a known
                        state before the MIDI is played e.g. homing the axes
                        if supported or required. (default: None)
  -postfix [POST_FILE], --postfix [POST_FILE]
                        A file containing Gcode to return your machine to a
                        known state after the MIDI is played e.g. homing the
                        axes if supported or required. (default: None)

Output settings:
  -axes XYZ, --axes XYZ
                        ordered list of the axes you wish to "play" the MIDI
                        data on. e.g. "X", "ZY", "YZX" (default: XYZ)
  -transpose Nx Ny Nz, --transpose Nx Ny Nz
                        Transposes each axis N keys up/down the scale, e.g. 12 0 0 will raise the X axis one octave.
  -verbose, --verbose   print verbose output to the terminal (default: False)

Midiparser.py is old and cludgy and fail to process some files. You may want to use python-midi by just providing -pymidi option,
but then you would need to install it manually from https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi,
